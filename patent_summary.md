# Patent Application Summary: Integrated Reproductive Health Tracking System

## Invention Title
Integrated Egg Count and Menstrual Cycle Tracking System

## Field of Invention
The invention relates to the field of reproductive health technology, specifically combining egg count estimation with menstrual cycle tracking in a unified system.

## Technical Problem Solved
Current reproductive health tracking systems lack integration between egg count estimation and menstrual cycle tracking, leading to fragmented user experience and incomplete health insights. Market research confirms no existing solution combines these features, requiring users to use multiple separate applications.
